# Data Drivers

The Data Driver is the low level part of Gemini that maps the API fields and Json to the data storage. Some drivers are available out of the box, but for complex use cases especially in enterprise context you are going to define your own driver where you are free to use your existing database and make your own optimizations.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Gemini provides easy to use Java interfaces to implement your own driver. Help or professional support is available for companies/professionals that collaborates with the project or are interested to use the platform.&#x20;
