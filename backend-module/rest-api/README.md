# Rest API

Everything on Gemini is based on the concept of _**Entity.**_ So also all the REST APIs that Gemini exposes come from an Entity definition.

This chapter is about the APIs exposed by the platform and a general overview of them. But you can easily jump on the [Entity definition](../the-schema-ddd/entities.md) to have specific documentation and use cases and come back when you need.

{% content-ref url="basic-crud/" %}
[basic-crud](basic-crud/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
