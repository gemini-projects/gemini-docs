# Rest API

Everything on Gemini is based on the concept of _**Entity.**_ So also all the REST APIs that Gemini exposes come from an Entity definition. This chapter is about the APIs exposed by the platform but you can easily jump on the [Entity definition](../the-schema-ddd/entities.md) and come back when you need.

{% content-ref url="insert-update.md" %}
[insert-update.md](insert-update.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
