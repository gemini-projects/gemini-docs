# Gemini Overview

![](.gitbook/assets/gemini\_logo\_blue\_small.jpg)

Gemini can be described as a framework or a platform composed of _**backend**_ and _**frontend**_ modules, that you can mix together to build **APIs** and **Full Web (Admin) Applications**.

Each module comes with **LowCode** features that are _**designed for Developers and Engineering Managers**_. This means that you can save a lot of time avoiding repetitive tasks on common stuffs, concentrating only in what matters adding value to your product or project. Backend Controllers and Frontend components are fully customizable allowing you to add your own code.

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Gemini**_ is built on top of enterprise and production ready frameworks and languages like _Micronaut_ (_Java_), _React_ (_Typescript_) and _Antd components_.

It simply adds some standards and conventions to build APIs, frontend components and full Single Page Applications leveraging the power of Cloud Native approach, microservices and microfrontends.
